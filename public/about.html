<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Redeye, a budding web developer with a passion for HTML. I've been diving deep into the world of coding, focusing primarily on HTML to build the foundation of my web development skills.</p>

<p>I find HTML fascinating because it's like the skeleton of the web â€“ it structures everything, from text to images, making websites come to life. Through my studies, I've learned how to create clean and organized code that not only looks good but also functions smoothly across different devices.</p>

<p>Every day, I'm excited to learn more about HTML and how it works hand in hand with other languages like CSS and JavaScript to create stunning web experiences. My goal is to continue honing my skills and eventually become a proficient full-stack developer..</p>
